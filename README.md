This is the react-firebase template that I created. There will eventually be more versions optimized for different kinds of apps that I build. Those have not yet been determined. They will be in different branches once that does occur.

It includes (or will) the following libraries and tools

* React
* React Router
* Firebase
* Ant Design 
* Styled Components


* `npm install yarn`
* `yarn`
* `yarn start`
* visit http://localhost:3000/
